 ## Procedure to create a usergruoup restriction using SmartEdit

4. Select the appropriate template.
5. Enter the necessary content details.
6. Fill in the information fields.

Next, click the "Add Restriction" button. SmartEdit will display the Add Restrictions panel.

7. From the "Restrictions Type" menu, select "Usergroup Restriction."
8. In the "Restriction" field, start typing the name of the restriction. If the restriction already exists, it will appear in the list. If not, click "Create" to define a new restriction.

**Note:** The restriction name must be unique.

9. Click "Create." The Add Restriction panel will now allow you to define the user group restriction.
10. In the "Name" field, confirm the user group restriction name.
11. If you want the restriction to apply to sub-user groups, click the "Apply restriction to sub-usergroups" button.
12. Select user groups for the restriction by placing your cursor in the "User Groups" field. A drop-down list of user groups will appear.
    - To narrow down the options, enter a search string, and only the user groups matching your criteria will be displayed.
    - Click a user group to select it for the restriction. Repeat this step to select multiple user groups.
13. Once all user groups have been selected, click "Add." The selected user groups will be added to the restriction and displayed at the bottom of the Add Restriction panel.

14. Click "Add." The User Group restriction is now added to the list of restrictions.

You can continue adding restrictions if needed. If there are multiple restrictions, you must specify how they should be applied:
   - **Match all**: The page or component will be displayed only when all restriction conditions are met.
   - **Match any**: The page or component will be displayed when any of the restriction conditions are met.

15. Continue to edit or create your page as desired. Once finished, save your changes.
