2. Open the page menu and select "Clone."
3. Click on the page title, choose either "Basic" or "Advanced" Edit.
4. Select "Clone," then fill in the necessary details and information for the cloned page.
5. Click "Add Restriction" to open the Add Restrictions panel in SmartEdit.
6. From the "Restrictions Type" menu, choose "Time Restriction."
7. In the "Restriction" field, start typing the restriction name. If an existing restriction with that name appears, select it from the list. If not, click "Create" to define a new restriction.
   
**Note:** The restriction name must be unique.

8. Click "Create" to proceed. The Add Restriction panel will display fields for defining your time restriction.

11. Click "Add." If there are multiple restrictions, specify how they should be applied:
    - "Match all": The page or component is shown only if all restriction conditions are met.
    - "Match any": The page or component is shown if any of the restriction conditions are met.
12. Continue editing your page or component as needed, and save your changes once complete.
